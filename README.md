# flex-horseshoe-card-bundle

This is a bundle of awesome [flex-horseshoe-card](https://github.com/AmoebeLabs/flex-horseshoe-card).

Thank you very much @AmoebeLabs

I just took the map and packed all the dependencies into a JS file to avoid CORS issues.

Simply download the JS and replace the original JS. You may also need to delete the gz file.
