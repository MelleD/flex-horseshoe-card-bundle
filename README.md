# flex-horseshoe-card-bundle

Simply copy this [file](https://github.com/MelleD/flex-horseshoe-card-bundle/blob/main/flex-horseshoe-card.js
) (preffered the raw content directly) the flex-horseshoe-card.js and replace the original JS (typically in www/community/flex-horseshoe-card folder). You may also need to delete the gz file.

And off course delete the browser cache :-)


This is a bundle with all depedencies of awesome the [flex-horseshoe-card](https://github.com/AmoebeLabs/flex-horseshoe-card) (don't copy this repo :-)! ).
I just took the card and packed all the dependencies into a JS file, because on my HA instance I get some CORS issues.

Thank you very much @AmoebeLabs for the whole work. I really like your code.
